This is the mobile app component of scaveture, which is an Android app.

Scaveture is prototype I wrote in mid 2011, with the intention of 
demo-ing at a Startup Weekend or similar event. That never panned 
out, but the prototype works, so I figured I'd share the code with 
whomever cared to re-use it. The code itself is crap, some of the 
ugliest I've ever written, but it proved a concept and may be 
educational to anyone trying to do something similar.

As for the concept I endeavored to prove, the idea was to build a 
site + mobile app that would serve as a device-centric scavenger 
hunt. Users could create a new hunt on the site, then players 
could take pictures of items in the real world and upload them to 
the game. Players could join games anonymously, and eventually 
you'd build up a catalog of real world items, indexed for search.
Over the next couple of years, companies like Foursqaure and 
Findery began taking a similar approach: using games to index 
the real world for search. While it was nice to see my vision 
validated in this way, it was bittersweet in that my idea, as 
pitched to Startup Weekend Seattle 2011, was not chosen for 
the implementation phase. Alas.
